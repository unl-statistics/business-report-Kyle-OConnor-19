Specifically, these are the data used to create figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 and tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These data are the results of standardized drumline surveys from Miami through the middle Florida Keys to examine spatial, seasonal, and environmental patterns in shark occurrence, catch per unit effort, composition, and demographic structure. Between 2009 and 2021, a total of 21,755 drumlines were deployed, capturing 3,398 sharks, comprising fifteen species. Ginglymostoma cirratum, (n=1335), Carcharhinus limbatus, (n=650), Negaprion brevirostris, (n=314), C. leucas, (n=253), and Sphyrna mokarran, (n=238) were the most common species encountered. At the assemblage level, relative abundance among regions and seasons were generally similar; however clear species-specific patterns of abundance, size structure, and sex-composition were detected by season, region, habitat, and management zones. These data serve as a baseline for future monitoring of shark populations in South Florida and assessing their response to environmental change. Mark recapture sharks were also analyzed to provide insights into the distances traveled and time at liberty.},

	doi = {10.1175/WAF-D-20-0127.1},
	abstract = {This work investigates how the relationship between tropical cyclone ({TC}) tornadoes and ambient (i.e., synoptic-scale) deep-tropospheric (i.e., 850–200-{hPa}) vertical wind shear ({VWS}) varies between coastal and inland environments. Observed U.S. {TC} tornado track data are used to study tornado frequency and location, while dropsonde and radiosonde data are used to analyze convective-scale environments. To study the variability in the {TC} tornado–{VWS} relationship, these data are categorized by both 1) their distance from the coast and 2) reanalysis-derived {VWS} magnitude. The analysis shows that {TCs} produce coastal tornadoes regardless of {VWS} magnitude primarily in their downshear sector, with tornadoes most frequently occurring in strongly sheared cases. Inland tornadoes, including the most damaging cases, primarily occur in strongly sheared {TCs} within the outer radii of the downshear-right quadrant. Consistent with these patterns, dropsondes and coastal radiosondes show that the downshear-right quadrant of strongly sheared {TCs} has the most favorable combination of enhanced lower-tropospheric near-surface speed shear and veering, and reduced lower-tropospheric thermodynamic stability for tornadic supercells. Despite the weaker intensity farther inland, these kinematic conditions are even more favorable in inland environments within the downshear-right quadrant of strongly sheared {TCs}, due to the strengthened veering of the ambient winds and the lack of changes in the {TC} outer tangential wind field strength. The constructive superposition of the ambient and {TC} winds may be particularly important to inland tornado occurrence. Together, these results will allow forecasters to anticipate how the frequency and location of tornadoes and, more broadly, convection may change as {TCs} move inland.},
